# Project 2 : Explore US Bikeshare Data
*November 6, 2022*

## Overview
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I have imported the data to answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also I had to write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
